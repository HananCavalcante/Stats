Just some of the measures include:

* Mean
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Min and Max
* Quantiles
* ...

## Practice

Run and Extend [Summary](https://github.com/REU-SOS/Stats/blob/master/src/summary.R):

* What are the summary statistics of vote counts?
* How does this compare with comments?
* Can you think of a new query to measure?
