# Tests

### t-test

The most standard t-test you'll find in statistics in the student's t-test. This is a test for significant differences between means of two populations, assumming the populations follow a normal distribution.

### effect size

Effect size is a measure of the "importance" of a difference. Cohen's D is one way to estimate the strength of possible difference between two populations.

| Effect size	| r   |
|-------------|-----|
| Small       |	0.10|
| Medium	    | 0.30|
| Large	      | 0.50|

### Correlation

Correlation is a measure of association between two distributions. For example, we can measure if there is a correlation between posts receiving votes and getting comments.

## Practice

Run and extend [Tests.R](https://github.com/REU-SOS/Stats/blob/master/src/tests.R)

* Are posts that contain iphone get significantly more votes or comments than those without?
* Are posts that contain android get significantly more votes or comments than those without?
* Is day of week correlated with number of votes?
